## Purpose
This is a personal project for creating data structures in a variety
of different languages.  Data structures are the basic building blocks
for organizing memory for flexible, extensible purposes.  Manipulating
memory in a language requires a comprehensive understanding of how the
language works at a core level.


## Supported Languages
- c


## Supported Data Structures
- arraylist


## How To Test
Testing scripts are provided:
### C
On a linux command line, navigate to the `c` directory and run `sh test.sh`.


## How To Use
### C
Write `#include "arraylist.h"` in your c program to use the arraylist.
